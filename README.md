# Example: Wizard Duel Tournament

**Description:** Develop a wizard duel tournament simulator where multiple wizards compete against each other in magical battles.

**Steps:**

1. Write a failing test case to verify that a wizard has a name, health, and a set of spells.
2. Implement the minimal code required to make the test pass.
3. Continuously refactor the code, improve test coverage, and ensure that all tests pass.
   
4. Write a failing test case to verify that a wizard can learn new spells.
5. Implement the code to make the test pass.
6. Continuously refactor the code, improve test coverage, and ensure that all tests pass.
   
7. Write a failing test case to verify that a wizard can cast a spell on another wizard.
8. Implement the code to make the test pass.
9. Continuously refactor the code, improve test coverage, and ensure that all tests pass.

10. Write a failing test case to verify that a wizard's health decreases when they are hit by a spell.
11. Implement the code to make the test pass.
12. Continuously refactor the code, improve test coverage, and ensure that all tests pass.
    
13. Write a failing test case to simulate a wizard duel tournament where multiple wizards compete against each other.
14. Implement the code to make the test pass.
